## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Appwrite Backend

The backend is crucial for the application to function. A detailed, step-by-step guide is available in the project documentation.

**‚û°Ô∏è See: [docs/database-setup.md](./docs/database-setup.md)**

This guide will walk you through:
1.  Creating an Appwrite project.
2.  Setting up the required Database, Collections, and Attributes.
3.  Configuring a Storage bucket for media.
4.  Deploying server-side Functions for sending emails.
5.  Creating an admin user account for the dashboard.

### 4. Configure Application Settings

This project uses a central configuration file to manage Appwrite settings. You will need to edit this file with the values from your Appwrite project.

1.  Open the `src/constants.ts` file in your code editor.
2.  Replace all placeholder values (e.g., `'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'`) with the actual IDs and credentials you obtained during the Appwrite setup.

For a detailed list of all required values and more in-depth setup instructions, please refer to the backend setup guide.

### 5. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and the configuration is set, start the local development server.

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be running on a local port (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
