# FirstVideos Group - Website & CMS

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Appwrite Backend

The backend is crucial for the application to function. A detailed, step-by-step guide is available in the project documentation.

**‚û°Ô∏è See: [docs/database-setup.md](./docs/database-setup.md)**

This guide will walk you through:
1.  Creating an Appwrite project.
2.  Setting up the required Database, Collections, and Attributes.
3.  Configuring a Storage bucket for media.
4.  Deploying server-side Functions for sending emails.
5.  Creating an admin user account for the dashboard.

### 4. Configure Frontend Constants

After setting up your Appwrite backend, you must update the hardcoded configuration file with the IDs from your Appwrite project.

Open `src/constants.ts` and replace the placeholder values with your actual Appwrite credentials.

```typescript
// src/constants.ts

export const APPWRITE_ENDPOINT = "https://[YOUR_REGION].cloud.appwrite.io/v1";
export const APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID";
export const APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID = "YOUR_DATABASE_ID";
export const PROJECTS_COLLECTION_ID = "YOUR_PROJECTS_COLLECTION_ID";
// ... and so on for all other constants.
```

### 5. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and the configuration is set, start the local development server.

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be running on a local port (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
